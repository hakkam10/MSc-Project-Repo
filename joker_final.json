It has no  connection to any of the DC films that have come before it.  We see it as a classic Warner Bros. movie. Gritty, intimate  and oddly funny, the characters live in the real world and  the stakes are personal.  Although it is never mentioned in the film, this story takes  place in the past.  Let's call it 1981.  It's a troubled time. The crime rate in Gotham is at record  highs. A garbage strike has crippled the city for the past  six weeks. And the divide between the \"haves\" and the \"have-  nots\" is palpable. Dreams are beyond reach, slipping into  delusions.

His greasy, black\r\n    hair is matted down. He's wearing an old, faded red hooded\r\n    zip-up sweatshirt, a threadbare gray scarf, thin from years\r\n    of use, hangs loosely around his neck.\r\n\r\n    WE NOTICE TWO FADED OLD SCARS cut at the corners of his\r\n    mouth. Almost forming a smile.\r\n\r\n    He's sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50's),\r\n    African American. Her office is cramped and run-down in a\r\n    cramped and run-down building.

Huge billboards,    giant movie marquees, garbage bags piled high everywhere.    Underneath it all we hear a TINKLING PIANO playing something    bouncy and fast-paced.    FROM ACROSS THE BUSY CITY STREET, we see Joker. He's dressed    as a sad-faced HOBO CLOWN. This is his job.    Dressed in tattered clothes, dark five o'clock shadow painted    on his face, big bulbous red nose, his mouth's outlined in    white, turned down at the corners.    He's holding up a sign in front of Kenny's Music Shop that    reads, \"EVERYTHING MUST GO!\" A banner above the store reads,    \"GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!\" Behind him, an OLD MAN plays a piano    on the street. Both of them there to draw attention to the    big sale going on in the store.    Joker's doing a little Charlie Chaplin like waddle to the    music. Most people walk right past, ignoring him. A few bump    into him by mistake.    JOKER SEES A GROUP OF FIVE BOYS, no more than 15-years-old,    walking toward him. He moves out of their way. They crack up    laughing when they see him. Start making fun of him.                                                                6.    Joker ignores them, tries to do his job the best he can while    maintaining some dignity. Keeps dancing and holding up the    sign.    One of the kids knocks the sign out of Joker's hands--                        KID #1              Suck my dick, clown.    The kids laugh. Joker doesn't say anything. Just bends over    to pick up the sign--    Another kid kicks him in the ass--                        KID #2              Whoops.    Joker falls face first onto the sidewalk. Oddly, the old man    playing the piano picks up the pace of the music--    The kids crack up. One of the boys grabs Joker's sign and    takes off running across the street--    The other kids follow, weaving through traffic--    Joker gets up and gives chase. He needs his sign back.    He almost gets hit by a taxi, spinning out of the way just in    time-- Spinning right into another taxi that stops just short    of hitting him.    Joker keeps running through traffic. People stare. A clown    barreling down the street has got to be a joke--3   "

His make-up's washed off, costume and props all shoved into a    big shopping bag slung over his shoulder. Some white grease-    paint still smudged on the sides of his face.    He finds an empty seat in the back of the bus. Sees a sad-    eyed FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL, face puffy from crying, sitting on    her knees looking back at him. Her mother's facing forward,    but even from behind you can tell she's angry.    Joker sees the sad-eyed girl staring straight back at him. He    doesn't know where to look, feeling self-conscious and small.    He gets back into \"character\" smiling like a clown and covers    his face with his hands-- Starts playing the peek-a-boo game    with her.

He covers his mouth    trying to hide it-- Shakes his head, laughter pausing for a    moment, but then it comes on stronger. His eyes are sad. It    actually looks like the laughter causes him pain.                                                                                   8.    People on the bus are staring.

He    reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small card. Hands it to    the woman.    CLOSE ON THE CARD, it reads: \"Forgive my laughter. I have a    condition (more on back)\"    She turns the card over and there is a bunch of information    in small writing--    \"It's a medical condition causing sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughter that    doesn't match how you feel. It can happen in people with a brain injury or certain    neurological conditions.\"    She doesn't read it (but if you freeze frame the movie you    could). She just shakes her head annoyed and throws the card    on the ground.    Joker laughs harder. Tears running down his face.    Not wanting to attract any more attention to himself, he    pulls up his red hood, and uses his threadbare scarf to cover    his mouth, trying to muffle the laughter.    He looks out at the city passing him by.5   "

Well, tell your mom I said              hello.    And Sophie and GiGi walk down the hall-- the opposite way of    Joker. He just stands there for a beat. Heart beating fast.

CLOSE ON JOKER LOOKING UP, interrupted from ripping out the     picture. One YOUNG DOCTOR and TWO NURSES are standing around     him. We stay with Joker, don't see their faces.

YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)               You were the guy on Murray Franklin               last night, right?     He hears the nurses giggle.                         JOKER               No, sorry. Wasn't me.                         NURSE #1 (OS)               Of course it was you. You were the               comedian.

He just shakes his head.                         JOKER               I don't know what you're talking               about.                         YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)               No. It was definitely you, buddy.               You're the guy who couldn't stop               laughing. Murray killed you.     More laughter. Joker looks up at them.                         JOKER               If I were you, I'd walk away from               this table before I strangle all               three of you with that fucking               stethoscope hanging from your neck.

If you want these          records you have to get your mom to          sign a patient disclosure form. I          can have someone mail you one.Joker just sits there, thinking it all over for a moment.Then snatches the file off the clerk's desk--The clerk grabs it as well.They play tug-of-war with the file, it's awkward and goes onway too long. Finally, Joker shoves the guy hard and pullsthe file away--                                                              79.     He takes off running out of the office with it.

Joker slips the clown mask over his clown face--                  AND JUST STANDS THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CHAOS, at home         with the chaos all around him--                                   Garrity and Burke spot Joker's rust colored suit in the           middle of the unruly mob--                                        Burke pulls his gun--                                                                 BURKE                                                       (shouting)                                                    EVERYBODY DOWN, GOTHAM PD!

Keeps yelling for the       crowd to get down, get down, but they don't listen to him--       He starts shoving protestors down, out of the way-- and           AND THEN THE MOB TURNS ON HIM AND GARRITY, starts closing in      around them--                                                     Garrity and Burke are pointing their guns at the crowd,           yelling panicked for them to back off, back off, and one          idiot reaches for Garrity's gun--                                 Bang.                                                                                                                             98.

MURRAY FRANKLIN                    (on the spot; defensive)                You don't know the first thing                about me, pal. Look what happened                because of what you did, Arthur,                what it led to. There are riots out                there. Two policemen are in                                             critical condition, someone was                                         killed today.                                                                                                        113.

JOKER                                                       How about another joke, Murray?

Murray pauses for a minute, not really listening to Joker,      suddenly realizing the seriousness of the situation. He      starts to turn to camera--                          JOKER                    (pulls Randall's gun)                                             I'll tell you what you get.

Joker slides his journal across to her. She picks it up and             flips through the pages--                                               ANGLE ON JOURNAL, blank page after blank page, there's                  nothing inside of it.                                                   The doctor looks up at him confused.                                    ANGLE ON JOKER, a smile creeping across his face. And we HEAR           the groovy organ opening to FRANK SINATRA's anthem \"That's              Life\"...
